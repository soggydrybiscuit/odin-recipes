    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy seitan recipe is the best I've ever used. I make it often to use on sandwiches and in 
        stir-fries.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup vital wheat gluten</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups vegetable broth, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup liquid aminos (such as Bragg®)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>¼ cup tamari</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir wheat gluten, 1/2 cup broth, liquid aminos, nutritional yeast, oil, and garlic together 
            in a bowl until ingredients come together into a ball. Knead until dough has a rubbery texture. 
            Divide dough into 3 equal pieces and shape into 1/2-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 4 cups vegetable broth, water, and tamari in a large pot; bring to a boil. 
            Carefully lower patties into boiling broth; cover the pot and return to a boil. Set the lid 
            slightly askew to vent steam and reduce the heat to low. Continue simmering, turning occasionally, 
            until patties are firm, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and uncover the pot. Allow patties to cool in broth for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
