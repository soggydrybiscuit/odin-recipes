This project was made tot est my HTML skills that I learnt while doing the Odin Project.
It entails creating a website using HTML skills that I learned throughout the course.
The actual coding of the website was not too difficult as all three different recipes involved the same format.
I struggled with understanding how the git commit messages worked and how to do them but I figured it out in the end.
